# Member's Desktop Computing at MSRI

Members desktops are a mix of Linux, Mac OS, and Windows. Members have a choice of what operating system they prefer. This information is usually collected via survey before the member begins. You can always email IT to change your request (see contact information below). Please allow a few days for this change to process and for the IT department to ready your equipment.

## Initial Login
