## Member Management in Sococo
Each user can be classified in three ways; Member, Moderator or Admin. Without altering settings, members can only move around the spaces and interact with links. Moderators can add or change links and alter room names. Admins can change all the settings and add members, add or delete spaces. If you are going to be configuring Sococo you will have been granted Admin permissions by the IT staff.
