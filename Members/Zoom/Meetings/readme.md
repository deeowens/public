### How to Create a Meeting

Desktop: To schedule a meeting, click **Schedule**.

Enter the desired information. We strongly recommend that you **do not** change the **Meeting ID** settings, leave it at **Generate Automatically**.

Tip: If you'd like to start a quick meeting on the fly, you can refer to the first picture, click **New Meeting**, and your Personal Meeting ID will be the number used by attendees to join your meeting. Make sure you share that number with attendees.
